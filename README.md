# shadcn/ui-`preact`

An unofficial, `Preact` port of `shadcn/ui`.

This is **NOT** a component library. Itâ€™s a collection of re-usable components that you
can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm. I have no
plans to publish it as an npm package (for now).

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs.
The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

**Why if Preact is compatible with React?**

Shadcn/ui is built upon Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. While Radix UI offers a robust set of components, it introduces several dependencies that may not align seamlessly with Preact projects. This port aims to provide better integration with Preact and reduce reliance on external packages. Although some components may still require additional dependencies, every effort is made to minimize and adapt them as needed.
